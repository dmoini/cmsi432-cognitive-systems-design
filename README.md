# CMSI 432: Cognitive Systems Design

Selected programs from CMSI 432: Cognitive Systems Design course at Loyola Marymount University

- **assignment1**: Worked with the first two layers of the causal hierarchy, as well as causal discovery with structure learning, heterogenous data, identifiability, adjustment, and programmatic approaches.
- **assignment2**: Worked with the last layers of the causal hierarchy, as well as some linear structural causal models, and practical counterfactuals.
- **assignment3**: Worked with Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB) problems, implementing various Action Selection Rules (ASRs), and simulating their results.
- **assignment4**: Worked with Markov Decision Processes.
- **final-project**: An AI capstone project where we created a PacMan agent that learns how to best play capture the flag against other PacMan agents.
